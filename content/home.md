# Hi, I'm Phil <span class="wave" id="wave-emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I'm Phil, and I'm a software engineer from [Devon](https://www.visitdevon.co.uk/), UK. Pronouns: he/him.

I work with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp), [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and front end frameworks like [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

I'm a fan of the [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/). I dabble in [Serverless development](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) and JavaScript runtimes such as [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/). I'm experienced with a broad range of web technologies, as well as other forms of software development. I'm always eager to learn more.

I love to build beautiful, useable experiences with the latest web technologies. I'm a [user advocate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_advocacy), and I care about [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) and [performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance).

Ask me why I think accessibility is important, and I'll tell you it's because I believe the [web should be for everyone](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/policy-and-research/research-and-evidence/research-2024/internet-is-essential-utility-and-human-right). Whether your focus is ethical or business-oriented, we all benefit from an accessible web.
