I've put this list onto its own page, as no-one wants to read long lists of jargon. But you may be curious, or need to check whether I am experienced with a particular paradigm.

See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/philpicton/dotfiles) repo on GitHub for configurations. The branches `new-personal` and `work-macos` have the most up to date configs.

**tldr;** Senior level frontend developer and computer geek.

## Section 1 - Stuff I use and recommend

### Computer Operating systems

**Daily driver and work machine:** MacOs with [Rectangle]() window manager and [Alfred]()

**Preferred dev environment:** [Arch linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) with [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) window manager and the [ML4W configuration](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/hyprland-starter)

**Can use if really necessary:** Windows 10/11ðŸ‘Ž

**Mobile**: iOS

### Code Editor

#### Daily driver and preferred editor

Neovim with my own customisations and using the [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) distro

#### Before that

VSCode, Sublime Text

#### Can use if necessary

JetBrains IDEs

#### Theme

[Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com), [NightOwl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), [Fira Code Font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

### Keyboard

#### Daily drivers

- Self built [Corne Cherry v2](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/blob/main/docs/corne-cherry/v2/buildguide_en.md) ergonomic keyboard with my own querty keymap.
- [Keychron K2 mechanical](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)

---

### Other Peripherals

- [LogiTech MX Master](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/mx/master-series.html)
- [Sony WM-1000X M3](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3/buy/wh1000xm3s.ce7?dtlinfo=wtb|product_tech_specs:wh-1000xm3) headphones

### LLMs (aka AI)

For security reasons, my current employer does not allow us to use cloud based coding agents/LLMs, so for work I use [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run local models for some coding tasks. I use the [gen.nvim](https://github.com/David-Kunz/gen.nvim) Neovim plugin to interact with the models from my editor.
Current choices: Mistral or Deepseek-Coder (very resource heavy).

For other projects I use Copilot and Copilot chat in Neovim (currently with Claude Sonnet 4.5), the [Github Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli), and run experiments with [GitHib spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).
I was an early adopter of the [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) terminal, and participated in beta testing.

I should state at this point that I am very aware of the limitations of, and pitfalls associated with, LLM-based coding tools, and the importance of taking responsibility for all the code shipped. Knowledge and application of sound engineering principles is still vital for serious software projects.

### CLI / Terminal

I use Zsh in [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my go-to terminal, and do all of my coding and work there, including writing documents using the Obsidian Neovim plugin. For my config, see my dotfiles.
Other terminal (TUI) apps I use include [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), [LazyDocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), [Starship](https://starship.rs) to show git status in the prompt, [Zsh auto suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), [Zsh auto-complete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete), and [Zsh syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).
Package managers- I use [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) on Mac, and [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) in Arch
