# About me

---

Welcome. This page is aimed mainly at potential employers, clients, or collaborators who want to know a bit more about me.

### Intro and work history

I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in the beautiful countryside of rural Devon. I've been working in tech for over eleven years, and Iâ€™m currently part of a fantastic team at a Tourism focussed Software-as-a-Service company based right here in Devon. Before that, I founded, and spent several years leading, a multi-award-winning web design and digital marketing agency. Helping clients bring their digital visions to life.

I studied Software Engineering at Uni, but then my career started in a very different space. I became a chef and then restaurateur, and had a long and successful career in the hospitality industry.

After classical training in Switzerland, where I also learned fluent German, I worked in top-end restaurants, busy hotels and venues. Working my way up to becoming a head chef. I owned and ran a very highly regarded and award winning fine dining restaurant. I worked with famous chefs at iconic locations, and was behind the scenes at cookery TV productions. It was an incredible experience, but I eventually made the transition back into tech, and itâ€™s been an equally exciting journey ever since.

### Skillset

I specialise in front-end development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and then tools and frameworks such as Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, React, Sass, Tailwind and so on. Iâ€™m also heavily involved in serverless architecture, Lambda functions, and e-commerce platforms. On top of that, I've had the pleasure of working with 3D panoramas and virtual tours, helping to create immersive experiences right in the browser. My toolkit is full of modern developer tools, from Git and the command line to containerisation or the latest in large language models (LLMs).

I'm a kind, friendly and pragmatic person who loves solving problems and building things.

I have a long track record of leadership, and mentorship over my entire career. I love helping people grow and develop, and Iâ€™m always happy to share my knowledge and experience with others. I'm very proud of being a small part of what people I've mentored have gone on to achieve.

My experiences as a head chef and business owner have given me a lot of skills that are transferable to my work in tech. From handling high-pressure situations, to managing teams and budgets, to delivering exceptional customer service.

### Values and interests

In work and business environments we are often required to avoid conversations about politics. I tow the line in this regard, unless I need to use my privilege to call something out. But it is nevertheless important to me to say that I am a strong believer in equality, diversity and inclusion. I am committed to creating a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for everyone I work with.

In other words I am _not_ a [Tech Bro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_bro)!

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m often enjoying my hobbies. Iâ€™m an avid guitarist, love restoring classic vehicles, and am always diving into electronics and audio tech. I still do a lot of cooking, for friends and family. I also enjoy the outdoors, hiking, running, mountain biking and archery. This year (and probably next!) I will be enjoying spending some time doing various renovation projects around our home which is an old Devon stone cottage.

Thanks for taking the time to read a bit about me. If youâ€™d like to get in touch, please donâ€™t hesitate to [reach out](/contact).
