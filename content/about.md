# About me

---

I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in the beautiful countryside of rural Devon. I've been working in tech for over eleven years, and Iâ€™m currently part of a fantastic team at a Tourism focussed Software-as-a-Service company based right here in Devon. Before that, I spent a few years running a multi-award-winning web design agency. Helping clients bring their digital visions to life.

I specialise in front-end development, with a passion for Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, React, and CSS. Iâ€™m also heavily involved in serverless architecture, Lambda functions, and e-commerce platforms. On top of that, I've had the pleasure of working with 3D panoramas and virtual tours, helping to create immersive experiences right in the browser. My toolkit is full of modern developer tools, from Git and the command line to containerisation or the latest in large language models (LLMs).

I studied Software Engineering at Uni, but then my career started in a very different space. I became a chef and then restaurateur, and had a long and successful career in the hospitality industry. It was an incredible experience, but I eventually made the transition back into tech, and itâ€™s been an equally exciting journey ever since.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually enjoying my hobbies. Iâ€™m an avid guitarist, love restoring classic vehicles, and am always diving into electronics. I also enjoy mountain biking and archery when I need to switch gears and get outdoors. This year I will be spending some time doing various projects around our new home which is an old Devon stone cottage.

Thanks for stopping by!

Phil
