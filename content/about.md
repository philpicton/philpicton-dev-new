# About me

## Intro and brief work history

I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in rural Devon. I've been working in tech for over eleven years, and Iâ€™m currently part of the front-end engineering team at a Tourism focussed Software-as-a-Service company. I develop and maintain features for a product which handles millions of transactions a year, and has many household name brands as clients. Before that, I founded, and spent several years leading, a multi-award-winning web design and digital marketing agency.

I studied Software Engineering at Uni, but then my career started in a very different space. I became a chef and then restaurateur, and had a successful career in the hospitality industry.

After classical training in Switzerland, where I learned to speak German, I worked in top-end restaurants, and hotels. Working my way up to becoming a head chef. I owned and ran an award winning fine dining restaurant for a few years. I worked with famous chefs at iconic locations, and worked behind the scenes at cookery TV productions.

I made the transition back into tech around 2014, when my son was born. It has been an exciting and rewarding switch, and I really enjoy the challenges and wins that come with software development.

## Skills

Nowadays I specialise in front-end web development. [Read more about my tech stack](writing/my-tech-stack-coding-skillset). I'm a kind, friendly and pragmatic person who loves solving complex problems and building things well. I never stop learning, and dragging me away from the computer can be difficult when I'm deep into something! I am opinionated about coding and teamwork best practices, mainly because I've seen the results of ignoring them.

I have a long track record of leadership, and mentorship over my entire career. I love helping people grow and develop, and Iâ€™m always happy to share my knowledge and experience with others. I'm very proud of being a small part of what people I've mentored have gone on to achieve.

My experiences as a head chef and business owner have given me a lot of skills that are transferable to my work in tech. From handling high-pressure situations, to managing teams and budgets, to delivering exceptional customer service.

## Values and interests

In work and business environments we are often required to avoid conversations about politics. I tow the line in this regard, but it is nevertheless important to me to say that I am a strong believer in equality, diversity and inclusion. I am committed to creating a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for everyone I work with.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m often enjoying my hobbies. Iâ€™m an improving guitarist, love restoring classic vehicles, and am always diving into electronics and audio tech. I still do a lot of cooking, for friends and family. I also enjoy the outdoors, hiking, running, mountain biking and archery. This year (and probably next) I will be enjoying spending some time doing various renovation projects around our home which is an old Devon stone cottage.
