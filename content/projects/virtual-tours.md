## Overview

I worked with an industry-leading Virtual Tour Company to create immersive virtual tours of various locations. This project was a tour of a University campus, for prospective students to explore.

## Key Features

- Custom designed interface, using the Uni's branding.
- Menu driven navigation as well as navigation buttons embedded in the tour
- Accessibility menu
- Keyboard navigation
- Proprietary CMS integration - all content editable by client
- Video presentation and chat embeds via CMS

## Stack

- Integrated with the company's custom CMS built in PHP/Laravel
- Panoramas rendered using [KRPano](https://krpano.com/home/)
- Vanilla JS to provide UI reactivity and tour navigation
- CSS styling
- Websockets for Chat embeds
- Native video embeds using alpha channels to remove greenscreen

## Business Impact

At the time of this project, many Universities were implementing virtual tours due to Covid lockdowns. Being able to offer advanced features such as accessibility and a full fledged CMS gave the company a huge competitive advantage, and ultimately lead to winning further large projects for international brands.
