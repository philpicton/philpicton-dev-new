## Technical Implementation

Built using Vue.js for the frontend framework with Three.js powering the 3D rendering engine. The backend API is powered by Node.js and uses MongoDB for data persistence.

## Challenges & Solutions

## Results

The platform successfully reduced property viewing times by 60% and increased buyer engagement significantly.
