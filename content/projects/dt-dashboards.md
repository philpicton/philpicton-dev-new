## Overview

I developed several data heavy dashboards for the backoffice of the SAAS product. Some client facing and displaying key sales and other metrics, along with interactive controls for customisation of the data presented. Others were intended for use by the Dev team, particularly Site Reliability / Infrastructure engineers. Those displayed data relating to key platform metrics, or the Queue Lambda system.

## Key features

- All dashboard SPAs were implemented with authentication and granular permissions
- Visualisations powered by Chart.js and using our design system
- Auto refresh for live data
- Fully type safe and with 100% test coverage
- Accessible and reactive UIs and controls
- Options stored for future visits
- Fully documented

## Stack

- Vue 3
- Pinia State Management
- Typescript
- REST API
- Chart.js
- Vite
- Vitest & Vue test utils
- Custom UI components/design system
- Code Linting and formatting

## Business impact

The live metrics dashboards enable SRE colleagues to monitor the commerce activity of the platform during busy ticket launches, and make informed decisions about scaling and queue quotas. The business is achieving _five nines_ uptime, and this is a major competitive advantage.

The other dashboards have contributed to the product as a whole, and have received positive client feedback. Analytics data show that the majority of our client/users visit them on a daily basis. This contributes to our position as a market leader in terms of product features.
