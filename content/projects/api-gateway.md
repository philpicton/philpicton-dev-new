## Overview

A robust API gateway solution designed to handle millions of requests per day while providing advanced routing, authentication, and rate limiting capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests to appropriate microservices
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT and OAuth2 support
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect services from abuse
- **Request Transformation**: Modify requests and responses on the fly
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time metrics and logging

## Technical Implementation

Written in Go for maximum performance and low memory footprint. Deployed on Kubernetes for scalability and high availability. Redis provides distributed caching and rate limiting.

## Performance Metrics

Handles 10,000+ requests per second with sub-10ms latency. 99.99% uptime achieved through redundant deployments and health checks.
