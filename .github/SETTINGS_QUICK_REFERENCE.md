# GitHub Settings Quick Reference

## 🚀 Critical Settings for Auto-Merge to Work

### 1️⃣ Actions Permissions (REQUIRED!)

```
Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
```

- ✅ **Read and write permissions** (not Read-only!)
- ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
- Click **Save**

**Why:** Without this, workflows cannot approve or merge Dependabot PRs.

---

### 2️⃣ Security Features (REQUIRED!)

```
Settings → Security & analysis
```

Enable all:

- ✅ **Dependency graph**
- ✅ **Dependabot alerts**
- ✅ **Dependabot security updates**
- ✅ **Secret scanning** (if available)

**Why:** Dependabot needs these to create PRs.

---

### 3️⃣ Branch Protection (REQUIRED!)

```
Settings → Branches → Add rule
```

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

**Settings:**

```
✅ Require a pull request before merging
   └─ Required reviews: 0 (for auto-merge) or 1+ (for manual review)

✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   └─ ✅ Require branches to be up to date
   └─ Add these checks:
      • test (unit tests)
      • quality-checks
      • lint-and-format
      • build
      • audit (optional)

✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

❌ Allow force pushes: OFF
❌ Allow deletions: OFF
```

**Why:** Blocks bad code from being merged/deployed.

- [ ] Try creating PR → Checks run → "Merge" button disabled until green
- [ ] Settings → Actions → "Read and write" selected
- [ ] Settings → Actions → "Allow create and approve" checked

## 🎯 What Auto-Merge Means

### ✅ Auto-Merged (Safe Updates)

- Patch: `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` ✅
- Minor: `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` ✅
- Security fixes ✅
- If ALL checks pass ✅

### ❌ NOT Auto-Merged (Requires Review)

- Major: `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` ❌ (breaking changes)
- If ANY check fails ❌
- Workflow comments on PR with instructions

---

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Auto-merge not working"

**Fix:**

1. Check: Settings → Actions → "Read and write permissions"
2. Check: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. Check: Branch protection → Required reviews = 0
4. Verify: Dependabot PR is patch/minor (not major)

### "Status checks not appearing"

**Fix:**

1. Push any change to trigger workflows
2. Wait for workflows to complete
3. Refresh Settings → Branches page
4. Status checks appear after first run

### "Can't merge PR"

**This is correct!**

- Wait for checks to pass (green checkmarks)
- "Merge" button enables when checks pass
- If checks fail → fix code → push → checks re-run

### "Can't push directly to main"

**This is correct!**

- Branch protection blocks direct pushes
- Create branch → make changes → create PR
- Or temporarily disable protection (not recommended)

## 🎓 Different Setups

### Solo Developer (Auto-Merge Enabled)

```yaml
Required reviews: 0
Auto-merge: Works for patch/minor updates
Manual review: Only for major updates or failures
```

### Small Team (Hybrid)

```yaml
Required reviews: 1
Auto-merge: Works if 1 team member approves
Manual review: Always required, but auto-merge helps
```

### Enterprise (Strict)

```yaml
Required reviews: 2+
Auto-merge: Disabled (requires human review)
Manual review: Always required for everything
```

**Recommendation:** Start with solo setup, adjust as team grows.

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### When You Push

```
✅ Clean code → Lint → Tests → Build → Checks pass → Deploys automatically
❌ Bad code → Checks fail → Deployment blocked → Fix → Push again
```

### When Creating PR

```
✅ Checks pass → "Merge" button enabled (green)
❌ Checks fail → "Merge" button disabled → Fix → Re-run checks
```

### When Dependabot Creates PR

```
✅ Patch/Minor + All checks pass (lint, tests, build) → Auto-merged → Deployed
❌ Major version → Comment added → NOT merged → Manual review required
❌ Any check fails (tests, lint, types) → NOT merged → Fix required
```
